## Assignment
Using your knowledge of javascript basics, complete the provided methods to return the proper values. Use the browser Development Tools to run the commands

## Requirements

Several functions have been provided for you in the JavaScript document. You must provide the logic to complete the function.

The formulas are divided into 5 sections:

### Basic Math

| Formula | Equation | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Addition | a + b | a & b are any real number |
| Subtraction | a - b | a & b are any real number |
| Multiplication | a * b | a & b are any real number |
| Division | a / b | a & b are any real number |

### Area

| Formula | Equation | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Square | A = s<sup>2</sup> | where s = any side of the square  |
| Rectangle | A = lw | where l = length and w = width  |
| Parallelogram | A = bh | where b = base and h = height |
| Triangle | A = (1/2)bh| where b = base and h = height |
| Circle | A = π r<sup>2</sup> | where π = 3.14 and r = radius |
| Sphere | S = 4 π r<sup>2</sup> | where s = Surface area  |

### Surface Area

| Formula | Equation | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Cube | SA = 6s<sup>2</sup> | where s = any side |
| Cylinder (lateral) | SA = 2 π r h | where π = 3.14, r = radius, and h = height  |

### Perimeter

| Formula | Equation | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Square | P = 4s | where s = any side |
| Rectangle | P = 2l + 2w | where l = length and w = width |
| Triangle | P = s1 + s2 + s3 | where s = a side |
| Circle | C = π d | where π = 3.14 and d = diameter |

### Volume

| Formula | Equation | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Cube | V = S<sup>3</sup> | where S = any side |
| Rectangular Container | V = lwh | where l = length, w = width, and h = height |
| Cylinder | V = π r<sup>2</sup>h | where π= 3.14, r = radius, and h = height |
